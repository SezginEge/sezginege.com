I am a software engineer at AWS Developer Tools team, who is working on next generation of developer tools. Currently, I live in Berlin/Germany.

This is my semi-professional blog for thoughts on programming, but also on life and whatever else. **This blog, its content and opinions are my own.**

I would love it if you would subscribe to [my blog's RSS feed](https://www.sezginege.com/index.xml). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SezginEge), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sezginege/). If you just want to email me, go ahead and send an email to: <mail@sezginege.com>
