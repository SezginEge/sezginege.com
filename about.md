## About me

Hi! My name is Sezgin Ege. I am a software engineer, rider and traveller. Currently, I live in Berlin/Germany and work on AWS Developer Tools Team at Amazon, **but this blog, its content and opinions are my own**.

I usually blog about tech but not limited with that. I hope, you will also enjoy my blog posts about culture, gadgets, travelling etc.

I would love it if you would subscribe to [my blog's RSS feed](https://blog.sezginege.com/feed.xml). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SezginEge), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sezginege/). If you just want to email me, go ahead and send an email: <mail@sezginege.com> I am always happy to get in touch with people. If you have something to talk about or questions on anything, feel free to reach out!
